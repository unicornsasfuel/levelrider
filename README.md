# Level Rider
This is an audio plugin written in Faust that automates gain level adjustments, based on a target gain level, a time window over which overall loudness is calculated via RMS, and a maximum adjustment threshold.

This plugin is comparable to Waves Vocal Rider or Waves Bass Rider in its functionality, but is free and open-source.
